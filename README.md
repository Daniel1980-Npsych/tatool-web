Welcome to **tatool-web** - an open-source web based training and testing framework that you can use as the base for your computer based psychological research.

This framework builds on top of the ideas of our original Tatool Java-based client ([see our paper](http://link.springer.com/article/10.3758%2Fs13428-012-0224-y)), but was completely rewritten in JavaScript/HTML/CSS and of course improved and simplified.

This document contains information on how to download, install, and start using tatool-web.
