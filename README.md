    Important: This repository is currently under heavy development.
    
Welcome to tatool-web - an open-source web based training and testing framework that you can use as the base for your computer based psychological experiments.

This framework builds on top of the ideas of our original Tatool Java-based client, but was completely rewritten in JavaScript/HTML/CSS and of course massively improved and simplified.

This document contains information on how to download, install, and start using tatool-web.
