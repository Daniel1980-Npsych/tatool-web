<h1>Instruction</h1>
	
<p>
  As soon as all animals of one run have been shown, the grid will be cleared and all animals that appeared will be available in a second grid below the main grid. <br><span class='highlight_black'>It's your task now to drag and drop the animals from the bottom grid to the position where they appeared in the main grid.</span> Think before you move, as you can't change the position of an animal once it's been dropped in the main grid. Once you've dropped the last animal, you'll receive a visual feedback indicating which animals were placed correctly (green) and which animals were placed wrongly (red).
