<h2>Executable</h2>

<p>In this section you'll learn about the architecture of an Executable. Make sure to read the <a href ng-click="goPage('dev-glossary.html')">Tatool Glossary</a> first as this will help you to understand this and the following sections. In the following section 'A first Executable' you'll learn how to create your first Executable, to add it to your local Tatool environment project, and to embed it in a Module. In 'Advanced Executable', you'll learn how to present stimuli, record users' responses and to save the outcome trial data.</p>

<h3 id="architecture">Executable Architecture<span class="pull-right"><a href ng-click="scrollTo('top')"><i class="fa fa-caret-up fa-lg"></i></a></span></h3>

<p>The development of Executables in Tatool follows the architectural pattern of AngularJS, which is defined as an <a href="https://plus.google.com/+AngularJS/posts/aZNVhj355G2" target="_blank">MVW</a> (Model-View-Whatever) framework. This means that every Tatool Executable consists of three parts:</p>

<p><b>Service (&asymp; Model)</b> - JavaScript<br>This is where the business logic of the Executable sits. Here we do all the heavy lifting, such as reading stimuli files, preparing stimuli for being displayed, and saving the trial (outcome) data.</p>

<div class="hint">
  <div class="icon red"><i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-2x"></i></div> 
  <div class="text">
    <p>Every Service is created only once per <i>Session</i> execution. Therefore, variable values will persist from one trial execution to the next.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p><b>Template (= View)</b> - HTML<br>This is where the view logic of the Executable sits. The view is represented as a simple HTML page which defines where you want the stimuli to appear on the screen and how that should look like.</p>

<p><b>Controller (= Whatever)</b> - JavaScript<br>With the Service and the Template in place, the only thing missing is the "Whatever" part. In the case of a Tatool Executable, the Controller takes on the "Whatever" role. The Controller mediates between your Service (Model) and the Template (View). This mediation is bidirectional: On the one hand, the user can click on a button in your Template and the Controller will pick up this interaction and tell the Service about it. On the other hand, the Controller can ask the Service for a new Stimulus and hand it over to the Template to display. Think of the Controller as the script deciding what to do when, but keep in mind, that most of the work is done by the Service.</p>

<div class="hint">
  <div class="icon red"><i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-2x"></i></div> 
  <div class="text">
    <p>Every Controller is created once per <i>Executable</i> execution. Therefore, variable values will <i>not</i> persist from one trial execution to the next. Hence, use the Service for variable values you want to be persistant.</p>
