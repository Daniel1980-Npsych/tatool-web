<h2>Executable</h2>

<p>In this section you'll learn how to create your first Executable, to add it to your local tatool environment project, and to embed it in a Module. Make sure to read the <a href ng-click="goPage('dev-glossary.html')">Tatool Glossary</a> first as this will help you to understand this and the following sections.</p>

<p>The development of Executables in Tatool follows the architectural pattern of AngularJS, which is defined as an <a href="https://plus.google.com/+AngularJS/posts/aZNVhj355G2" target="_blank">MVW</a> (Model-View-Whatever) framework. This means that every Tatool Executable consists of three parts:</p>

<p><b>Service (&asymp; Model)</b> - JavaScript<br>This is where the business logic of the Executable sits. Here we do all the heavy lifting, such as reading stimuli files, preparing stimuli for being displayed, and saving the trial (outcome) data.</p>

<div class="hint">
  <div class="icon red"><i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-2x"></i></div> 
  <div class="text">
    <p>Every Service is created only once per <i>Session</i> execution. Therefore, variable values will persist from one trial execution to the next.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p><b>Template (= View)</b> - HTML<br>This is where the view logic of the Executable sits. The view is represented as a simple HTML page which defines where you want the stimuli to appear on the screen and how that should look like.</p>

<p><b>Controller (= Whatever)</b> - JavaScript<br>With the Service and the Template in place, the only thing missing is the "Whatever" part. In the case of a Tatool Executable, the Controller takes on the "Whatever" role. The Controller mediates between your Service (Model) and the Template (View). This mediation is bidirectional: On the one hand, the user can click on a button in your Template and the Controller will pick up this interaction and tell the Service about it. On the other hand, the Controller can ask the Service for a new Stimulus and hand it over to the Template to display. Think of the Controller as the script deciding what to do when, but keep in mind, that most of the work is done by the Service.</p>

<div class="hint">
  <div class="icon red"><i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-2x"></i></div> 
  <div class="text">
    <p>Every Controller is created once per <i>Executable</i> execution. Therefore, variable values will <i>not</i> persist from one trial execution to the next. Hence, use the Service for variable values you want to be persistant.</p>
  </div>

<p>With the theoretical background above, you can now create the three corresponding files for your first Executable which we're going to call 'myExecutable'. We'll talk you through the content of these files. Don't worry if the code looks complicated to you at first, it will all make sense in a few minutes.</p>

<hr class="hr-red">

<h3 id="service">Executable Service<span class="pull-right"><a href ng-click="scrollTo('top')"><i class="fa fa-caret-up fa-lg"></i></a></span></h3>

<h4>myExecutable.service.js</h4>
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="line-numbers language-javascript">tatool.factory('myExecutable', [ 'tatoolExecutable',
  function (tatoolExecutable) {  

    var MyExecutable = tatoolExecutable.createExecutable();

    MyExecutable.prototype.init = function() {
      // our Executable initialization code goes here
    };

    // our custom methods go here

    return MyExecutable;
  }]);
</code></pre>
<p>The tatool.factory() method in <b>line 1</b> will instantiate our Service for us. Because we're going to have multiple Services, we need to assign a unique name to our Service. The first argument of the tatool.factory() method defines just that name. Use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase" target="_blank">lowerCamelCase</a> to name your Executable Service and make sure that you use the exact same name as in the prefix in your filename. In our case the filename is 'myExecutable.service.js', so the name of our Executable Service has to be 'myExecutable'. This is important because at runtime, Tatool will look for the file according to the name you've given in your Service, and will fail to locate the file if they don't match.</p>

<p>The second argument of the tatool.factory() method is an array [] containing the dependencies and, as the last entry on <b>line 2</b>, the main function. As you can see, we've already added the dependency 'tatoolExecutable' which is a service provided by Tatool. Every dependency has to occur twice, once as a String entry in the array, and once as an argument in the main function. In case you have multiple dependencies, take care that also the order of the dependencies matches.</p>

<p>On <b>line 4</b> we create an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instance_%28computer_science%29" target="_blank">instance</a> of our Executable with the help of the tatoolExecutable Service, and on <b>line 12</b> we return that instance. Remember that every Service is created only once per Session and, therefore, things we create in here will persist across the execution of trials. Hence, wherever we will use this Executable Service, it will always return this one instance that we've just created.</p>

<p>Generally, we don't want our users to wait 5 seconds before every trial execution until the stimulus has loaded. To avoid any long running processes during the actual execution of your Executable, we create the default prototype method 'init' on <b>line 6</b>. This is a mandatory method required by Tatool which is called once at the beginning of every Session and allows for preparing (i.e., initialising) your Executable for execution. This can comprise the reading of stimuli files, preloading of stimuli material such as images or videos, and creation of objects that should be created only once per Session.</p>

<p>That's it for the basic structure of our Executable Service. You can use this example code as a starting point for programming your future Executables, as it contains the minimum code required for an Executable to run.</p>

<hr class="hr-red">

<h3 id="controller">Executable Controller<span class="pull-right"><a href ng-click="scrollTo('top')"><i class="fa fa-caret-up fa-lg"></i></a></span></h3>

<h4>myExecutable.ctrl.js (Controller)</h4>
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-javascript">tatool.controller('myExecutableCtrl', [ '$scope', 'service',
  function ($scope, service) {
    
    $scope.start = function() {
      // our code goes here
    }

    // our custom methods go here

  }]);
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, the first two lines look extremely similar to our Executable Service. This time, we're calling the method tatool.controller() in <b>line 1</b> which will instantiate our controller. As for the Service, we have to define the dependencies, but here we add two different ones. The Controller always needs the two dependencies $scope and service in order for him to fulfill its mediating role in terms of talking to our Template (using the '$scope') and our Service (using the 'service').</p>

<p>The body of our Controller contains only one mandatory method on <b>line 4</b>. It's called 'start' and belongs to the $scope service. This method is the starting point of your Executable and will be called once the Service, Controller and Template have loaded successfully. Inside this method, you'll later define what happens during the execution (e.g., displaying the stimulus and then wait for a response). </p>

<h3 id="template">Executable Template<span class="pull-right"><a href ng-click="scrollTo('top')"><i class="fa fa-caret-up fa-lg"></i></a></span></h3>

<h4>myExecutable.html (Template)</h4>
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-markup">&lt;tatool>
  &lt;!-- our code goes here -->
&lt;/tatool>
</code></pre>

<p>Yes, that's the minimum required code for a Template. Once all code contained within the tags has finished loading, the Tatool element (<b>line 1</b>) will call our Controllers' 'start' method.</p>
