<h2>Services</h2>

<p>Tatool offers a set of utility Services that help you when developing your own Executables/Handlers. The Services offer methods that can be used to access files, prepare stimuli, store trials, etc.. You can create your own Services, offering custom reusable code for your Executables/Handlers.</p>

<p>In order to use any of the utility Services, you'll need to add the dependency to your Executable Service or Controller. The following example shows you how to make use of the additional utility service called dbUtils in your Executable Service.</p>

<h4>myExecutable.service.js</h4>
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="line-numbers language-javascript">tatool.factory('myExecutable', [ 'executableUtils', 'dbUtils',
  function (executableUtils, dbUtils) {  

    var MyExecutable = executableUtils.createExecutable();

    MyExecutable.prototype.init = function() {
      // we can start using the dbUtils service here
      dbUtils.setSessionProperty(this, 'currentValue', 12);
    };

    // our custom methods go here

    return MyExecutable;
  }]);
</code></pre>
