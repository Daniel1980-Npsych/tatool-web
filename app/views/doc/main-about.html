<h2>About</h2>
<p>Tatool is an open-source software for running computer-based experiments, developed by <a href="http://psych.colorado.edu/~cognitive/co-researchers.html#bastian" target="_blank">Claudia von Bastian</a> (scientific lead), Andre Locher (technical lead), and Michael Ruflin (developer).</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Tatool is conceptualized according to the requirements for running psychological experimental studies. As Tatool's development is closely coupled to research on effects of cognitive training, it additionally boasts some features that are particularly useful in the context of large-scale and self-administered study settings (e.g., online monitoring of participants' compliance). In its original version, Tatool was developed as a <a href="http://www.tatool.ch" target="_blank">Java-based open-source framework</a>. Although some researchers picked up on it and used Tatool for their <!--<a ui-sref="documentation" ng-click="goPage('main-publications.html')"> -->research<!-- </a> -->, it soon became clear that the time-consuming and at times frustrating process of learning such a complex programming language as Java is an obstacle for the majority of researchers. However, the vision of Tatool is that computer-based experiments should be an easy task to do - for more experienced researchers but also for students and research assistants. </p>
<p>The main goal of the new Tatool was therefore to make it easier. Therefore, it is based on JavaScript and HTML 5, very widely used technologies that are much easier and faster to learn. To simplify matters even more, the new Tatool comes with an experiment editor that allows for quick and easy experiment development without having to write a single line of code!

<h3>Community</h3>
<p>The idea behind Tatool is to support the scientific community with an open-source, thus freely available framework for programming and conducting experiments and training studies. The source code of Tatool is available for further development by everyone. We hope that fellow researchers feel encouraged to help improving Tatool by contributing their ideas. </p>
