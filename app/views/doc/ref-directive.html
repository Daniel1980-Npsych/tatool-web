<h2>Template Services</h2>

<p>Tatool offers a set of template services that help you when developing your own Executables/Handlers. The Services offer methods that can be used to arrange, display and hide stimuli on-screen or to allow user input by keyboard and/or mouse.</p>

<p>In order to use any of the template services, you'll need to add the dependency to your Executable Service and/or Controller. The following example shows you how to make use of the template service called <i>stimulusServiceFactory</i> in your Executable Service.</p>

<h4>myExecutable.service.js</h4>
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="line-numbers language-javascript">tatool.factory('myExecutable', [ 'executableUtils', 'stimulusServiceFactory',
  function (executableUtils, stimulusServiceFactory) {  

    var MyExecutable = executableUtils.createExecutable();

    MyExecutable.prototype.init = function() {
      this.stimulusService = stimulusServiceFactory.createService(this.stimuliPath);
    };

    // our custom methods go here

    return MyExecutable;
  }]);
</code></pre>
