<b class="red big">Q: </b><b>What browsers are supported by Tatool?</b><br>
<b class="red big">A: </b>Tatool was successfully tested on Chrome 38.x, Firefox 33.x, Internet Explorer 11, Safari 7.1 and iOS Safari 8.1. Tatool should run successfully on any modern web browser (e.g. IE 10+, FF 31+, Chrome 36+, Safari 7.1+, iOS Safari 8+) that supports ECMAScript 5 and IndexedDB. We recommend to use the latest Chrome browser due to its best overall performance (e.g. animation smoothness, timing accuracy).

<b class="red big">Q: </b><b>Does Tatool run on an Apple iPad?</b><br>
<b class="red big">A: </b>Yes, but iOS Safari 8+ is required.

<b class="red big">Q: </b><b>How 'good' is Tatool's timing?</b><br>
<b class="red big">A: </b>Tatool uses the JavaScript high resolution timing API (performance.now()) when <a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=performance.now" target="_blank">supported</a> by the browser. This allows for sub-millisecond <b>precision</b>. In the case of a browser not supporting the high resolution timing API, Tatool falls back to Date.now() which allows for milisecond precision.<br>
The <b>accuracy</b> of timing results depends on several other factors that need to be addressed outside of Tatool. For a good explanation on what factors influence your timing accuracy we recommend reading <a href="http://www.blackboxtoolkit.com/why.html" target="_blank">this</a> (e.g. refresh rate, input device, operating system, browser) and to take appropriate measures to improve timing accuracy.

<b class="red big">Q: </b><b>Can I run my custom Executables on tatool-web.com?</b><br>
<b class="red big">A: </b>If you're willing to make your Executables available for other researchers, we'd be happy to host your Executables for free. In any other case we offer hosting for a small donation which helps us pay for our fixed hosting costs. <a href="http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k=01QxKZo9rpozcn32fS6INR3Q==&amp;c=bhVN7UDNOC6-tTzg17qtMw==" onclick="window.open('http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k\07501QxKZo9rpozcn32fS6INR3Q\75\75\46c\75bhVN7UDNOC6-tTzg17qtMw\75\075', '', 'toolbar=0,scrollbars=0,location=0,statusbar=0,menubar=0,resizable=0,width=500,height=300'); return false;" title="Reveal this e-mail address">Contact us</a>.

<b class="red big">Q: </b><b>How can I use my own Stimuli with tatool-web.com?</b><br>
<b class="red big">A: </b>You'll have to make your stimuli available somewhere where you can access them directly with an URL. If you don't have your own webhost, you can use your <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/en/help/16" target="_blank">dropbox public folder</a> instead, which allows you to access files directly. If you don't have a dropbox public folder (accounts after October 2012), you can still use dropbox by sharing a file and replacing www.dropbox.com with dl.dropboxusercontent.com in your shared link.

<b class="red big">Q: </b><b>Can I upload my own Stimuli to tatool-web.com?</b><br>
<b class="red big">A: </b>We currently don't support the upload of custom stimuli. If you're willing to make your stimuli available for other researchers, we'd be happy to host your stimuli for free. In any other case we offer hosting for a small donation which helps us pay for our fixed hosting costs. <a href="http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k=01QxKZo9rpozcn32fS6INR3Q==&amp;c=bhVN7UDNOC6-tTzg17qtMw==" onclick="window.open('http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k\07501QxKZo9rpozcn32fS6INR3Q\75\75\46c\75bhVN7UDNOC6-tTzg17qtMw\75\075', '', 'toolbar=0,scrollbars=0,location=0,statusbar=0,menubar=0,resizable=0,width=500,height=300'); return false;" title="Reveal this e-mail address">Contact us</a>.
