<h2>Editor</h2>

<p>The Editor is a convenient way to quickly and easily create experiments. The Editor interface consists of two parts, the module navigation on the left side and the module/element settings on the right side. Move your mouse over the Tooltip icons to get brief descriptions of each field.</p>

<p>The module setting comprise the basic module information (name, author, label), and the module behaviour settings. All module configurations are stored in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON" target = "_blank">JSON</a> format. To easily exchange modules with other researchers, you can download a JSON file by clicking on the <b>Download</b> button at the bottom of the Editor dialog.</p>

<p><a ui-sref="doc({page: 'ref-elements.html'})">Elements</a> (List or Dual Elements) group your Executables and can be executed for <i>n</i> iterations. <a ui-sref="doc({page: 'ref-handler.html'})">Handlers</a> are also set on the level of elements, which makes their functionality available to any child Executables or elements (e.g., another List Element). To see what properties can be set for the handlers, have a look at the <a ui-sref="doc({page: 'ref-handler.html'})">handlers reference</a>.</p>

<p>Executables can be understood as experimental paradigms. They are hence the most important component of your experiment. Browse our <a ui-sref="doc({page: 'main-lib.html'})">Task Library</a> to see which tasks are available. All of these tasks allow you to use your own stimuli, and most of them are so highly generic that you can tailor them to your needs tweaking their properties. The properties are listed for each task in the Task Library.</p> 

<p>You can also <a ui-sref="doc({page: 'main-dev.html'})">develop your own tasks</a>. If you're willing to share your Executables with other researchers, we'll be happy to host them for you for free! Otherwise, you can either run Tatool in offline lab mode (see <a ui-sref="doc({page: 'dev-getting-started.html'})">here</a>), host in on your own web server running Tatool, or we can host it for you in exchange for a small donation helping to cover our fixed hosting costs.</p>

<p>The Tatool Web Repository allows you to go live with your experiment with a few clicks of a button. After activating the Repository for your module, you'll have the opportunity of publishing your module as <b>Public</b> or <b>Private</b>.</p>

<p>A <b>Public</b> module not only allows every Tatool Web user to execute your module but it'll also allow you to share your module with people not registered with Tatool Web via a public URL (click on the Show URL link to get your custom link). This feature is required for Tatool Web to be used with Amazone Mechanical Turk.</p>

<p>A <b>Private</b> module only allows a user defined list of Tatool Web users to see and execute your module. In order to invite users you'll first have to Publish the module. After the module has been published you can define your users list by clicking on the Invite button next to the Publish button. </p>

<p>You can <i>Edit</i> your module any time, but have to <i>Publish</i> it again to make changes available to your users. Once you published such changes, users that have added your module first have to update it before they can execute it. This allows for dynamic adjustment as it might be required during piloting.</p> 

<p><b>Note:</b> To make sure that we have sufficient web space for everyone, we currently limit the number of simultaneously published modules per researcher to <b>3</b> at a time.</p>
