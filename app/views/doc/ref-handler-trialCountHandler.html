<h2>trialCountHandler</h2>

<p>The trialCountHandler can be used in combination with the counter status panel that can be activated for every Executable. The trialCountHandler provides the values for the counter status panel who takes care of displaying the values on screen.</p>

<p>The trial counter will always be reset to 1 at the beginning of a new session. Within a session the counter will be incremented by 1 after every execution of an Executable defined as a child of the current Element, regardless of whether a trial object is saved. In the case of a Dual Element, the counter will only increment after one iteration has completed (e.g. primary, secondary, primary). The counter status panel will be updated at the beginning of every new execution and should therefore show the count of the current trial.</p>
