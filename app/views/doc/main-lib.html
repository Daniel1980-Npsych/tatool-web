<h2>Task Library</h2>

<p>The Tatool Task Library lists all publically available Executables and provides an overview of any Properties that can be used to customize it. We're constantly working on creating new Executables that will become available for everyone. If you think you have an Executable you'd like to share with the community, let us know!</p>
