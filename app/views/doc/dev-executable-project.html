<h2>Setup Project</h2>

<p>In this section you'll learn how to setup your own Project, in order to have a common place for your Executables, stimuli files and other files required for your experiments.</p>

<hr class="hr-red">

<p><b>1. </b> Open your local Tatool by opening the website (e.g. http://127.0.0.1:3000) in your browser. Login with a user that has the 'Admin' role. Once logged in, click on the 'Admin' link in the top navigation. On the admin page you can select the 'Projects' tab at the top and add a new Project. Let's keep it simple for now and give the Project the name <b>'myExperiment'</b> of access type <b>'public'</b>, and provide your login email as the owner. Choose any text you like in the description (e.g., 'My first project'). In addition, we'll have to provide more detailed information about our Executable, so we can select it later in the Module Editor. Add the following text in the Executables (JSON) text field:</p>

<pre><code class="language-markup">[{"customType":"myExecutable","description":"Our executable"}]
</code></pre>

<p>As a next step, we're going to craete the basic files needed for an Executable. To proceed, please go to <a ui-sref="doc({page: 'dev-executable-templates.html'})">Create Executable</a>.</p>
