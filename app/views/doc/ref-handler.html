<h2>Handlers</h2>

<p>Tatool offers a set of Handler services that provide reusable functionality within your Modules.</p>

<p>Handlers are used to provide your Modules with reusable functionality. Instead of duplicating the same code in different Executables, you can extract the logic and make it available for multiple Executables, allowing them to share the same state. A simple example for this is a Handler called trialCountHandler, which does what the name suggests: it counts trials and allows you to display the information on screen independent of the Executable.</p>

<p>Handlers are attached to an Element in a Module, which makes the shared functionality available for all child elements. The current Module Editor doesn't support Handlers yet which is why you'll have to add them manually within a Module File. The following example shows how to manually add Handlers on <b>line 10-13</b>. Every Handler object has a customType property to define the service to load and a unique custom name.</p>
