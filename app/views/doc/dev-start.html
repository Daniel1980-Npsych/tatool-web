<h2>Development</h2>

<p>You want to learn how to develop <b>your own tasks and modules</b>? You've come to the right place. We'll guide you through the entire process, one step after another. First, have a look at the <a href ng-click="goPage('dev-basics.html')">Basics</a> to see what skills are required and to learn more about the technologies used by Tatool. Next, you'll have to get familiar with the terms and concepts Tatool uses. Take a few minutes to read through the <a href ng-click="goPage('dev-glossary.html')">Glossary</a>. Now it get's serious - <a href ng-click="goPage('dev-getting-started.html')">get started</a> and setup your local tatool environment. After that, you can go on and write your first own <a href ng-click="goPage('dev-executable.html')">Executable</a>.</p>

<p>You're fine with using the <b>pre-existing tasks</b> in Tatool's <a href ng-click="goPage('lib-start.html')">Task Library</a>? Then you don't have to setup or develop anything, simply use the built-in tatool Module Editor. Take a look at the <a href ng-click="goPage('modules-create.html')">Create Modules</a> section to learn more.</p>
