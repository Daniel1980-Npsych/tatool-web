        <h3>Experiment View</h3>
        <p>The actual experiment view comes with a set of pre-built features like feedback, trial, timer and level indicators. For stimuli presentation we provide
          easy to use html elements to display stimuli at specific positions on the screen.</p>

        <h3>Easy Publishing</h3>
        <p>As a developer you can decide to publish your experiment into the tatool repository as a public or a private module. Public modules can be installed by anyone and private modules can only be installed by the list of people you invite.</p>

        <h3>Experiment Editor</h3>
        <p>The Experiment Editor allows you to change an existing experiment quickly and easily without writing a single line of code. This even allows people with no programming knowledge to take existing experiments and customize them to their needs with own stimuli, timing, sequences, etc.</p>

        <h3>Data Export</h3>
        <p>As a Researcher your ultimate goal is to get access to the data collected during your experiment. Tatool provides a research view that gives you a detailed log of who's participating in your experiment and how many sessions they've completed. You can also conveniently download their data as a CSV file.</p>
